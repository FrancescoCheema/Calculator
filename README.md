# Calculator
Calculator Project from TheOdinProject
While working on this Calculator project, I came through a lot of hardships such as how to present the calculator, logical operations, restrictions. I came back from a break, as I'm working on credits for my Bachelor's degree, so I had to refresh myself on what I learned so far by watching my own projects.
However, planning accordingly with the use of pseudocode, and researching as much as possible the intrications of it, was quite fun and a great learning experience.
I've learned about the use of parseFloat, toFixed(), more CSS Animations, forEach()'s use on multiple buttons similar to Rock Paper & Scissors, converting strings to numbers and isFinite.
